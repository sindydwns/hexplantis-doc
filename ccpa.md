Do Not Sell My Personal Information
==============

You have the right to request that your personal information is not “sold” or “shared” for personalized advertising purposes.
In accordance with privacy laws, “sale” or “sharing” (for personalized ads) refers to the collection of certain information by us, or the permission for advertising partners to collect information, in order to provide personalized ads on our services and on other sites and apps you visit.

If you do not wish your personal information to be “sold” or “shared” for personalized ads, you can exercise your right to opt out at any time through the in-app settings.

When you opt out, a “deactivation” setting will be saved on your device to ensure that personalized ads are not shown.
If you delete and reinstall the app, you will need to opt out again.
